# Fake Job Posting Detection

## Introduction
The growing reliance on online employment platforms has led to a significant rise in fraudulent job postings. These scams typically have two main objectives:
1. Extract sensitive personal information.
2. Demand unauthorized payments.

### Goal
Develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model utilizing **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to detect fraudulent job postings based on textual descriptions. The project leverages various machine learning models and algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in job postings.
